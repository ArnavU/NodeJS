### In Node.js, the module wrapper is a set of code that surrounds the contents of a Node.js module. 

### It is essentially an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) that encapsulates the module's code. 

### The module wrapper provides a scope for the module's variables and helps in managing the module's exports and require statements.

``` javascript
(function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
  // Module code goes here
});
```

- ***exports:*** It is an object that the module can add properties and methods to. Anything assigned to exports becomes the public API of the module.

- ***require:*** A function to require other modules. It allows a module to include functionality from other modules.

- ***module:*** A reference to the current module. It is an object that has properties about the current module, such as module.exports.

- ***__filename:*** The filename of the current module. It is the full path to the current module file.

- ***__dirname:*** The directory name of the current module. It is the full path to the directory where the current module is located.

Here's a simple example to illustrate:

```javascript
// Inside mymodule.js

console.log(__filename);  // Full path to the current module file
console.log(__dirname);   // Full path to the directory of the current module

// Exporting a function as part of the public API
exports.myFunction = function() {
  console.log('This is my function in the module.');
};
```
